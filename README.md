Setting up and managing disk usage quotas on a Linux system involves several steps. Disk quotas allow you to allocate specific amounts of disk space or file usage to users or groups. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Enable Quotas on the Filesystem
Quotas must be enabled on the filesystem where you want to enforce limits.

a. Edit /etc/fstab
Add usrquota and/or grpquota to the filesystem options for the relevant partition. For example:

/dev/sda1 /home ext4 defaults,usrquota,grpquota 0 2
b. Remount the Filesystem
After modifying /etc/fstab, remount the filesystem for changes to take effect:

sudo mount -o remount /home
2. Install Quota Tools
Ensure quota management tools are installed:

sudo apt install quota           # On Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install quota           # On RHEL/CentOS
3. Initialize Quota Files
Create the necessary quota files on the filesystem:

sudo quotacheck -cum /home       # For user quotas
sudo quotacheck -cgm /home       # For group quotas
This creates aquota.user and aquota.group files in the root of the specified partition.

4. Enable Quotas
Turn on quota enforcement:

sudo quotaon /home
Verify quotas are enabled:

sudo quotaon -p /home
5. Assign Quotas to Users or Groups
a. Set User Quotas
To set limits for a specific user, use edquota:

sudo edquota username
This opens a text editor where you can define soft and hard limits for blocks (disk space) and inodes (number of files):

Disk quotas for user username:
/dev/sda1: blocks in use: 500, limits (soft = 1000, hard = 1200)
           inodes in use: 10, limits (soft = 20, hard = 25)
Soft limit: Warns the user when exceeded.
Hard limit: Strictly enforces the maximum usage.
b. Set Group Quotas
To set quotas for a group, use:

sudo edquota -g groupname
6. Check Quota Usage
For a specific user:

quota username
For a group:

sudo quota -g groupname
To display quota reports for all users:

sudo repquota /home
7. Monitor and Manage Quotas
a. Grace Periods
Set grace periods for soft limit violations using edquota -t:

sudo edquota -t
Modify the time allowed before exceeding soft limits is treated as a violation.

b. Turn Off Quotas
To disable quotas on a filesystem:

sudo quotaoff /home
c. Adjust Quotas
You can adjust quotas anytime by re-running edquota or updating the quota files directly.

8. Troubleshooting
Ensure the partition supports quotas (e.g., ext4, xfs).
Run dmesg or check logs for filesystem or quota-related errors.
By following these steps, you can effectively manage disk space utilization and ensure users or groups do not exceed allocated resources.
