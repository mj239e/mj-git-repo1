For the upcoming month, our team will focus on executing the scheduled MechID and certificate rotations across the Network Cloud (NC) and AIC environments. As outlined in our February calendar, we have a comprehensive rotation plan that ensures seamless updates and management of these critical credentials to maintain system security and reliability. Each week involves specific rotations assigned to different certificates, such as NC MechID, NC SSL, and AIC SSL, ensuring we meet all expiration deadlines in a timely manner. Our structured approach to scheduling allows for efficient coverage, minimizing disruptions and maintaining compliance across all environments. Additionally, we are identifying ways to optimize how we plan and monitor these rotations, ensuring our team remains ahead of any potential challenges.
